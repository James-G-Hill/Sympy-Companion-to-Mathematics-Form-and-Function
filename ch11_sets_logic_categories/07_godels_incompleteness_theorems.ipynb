Kurt Godel, using a subtle diagonal argument, proved an \"incompleteness\" theorem which showed that Hilber's objective can not be reached, except perhaps by some novel extension of the Hilbert idea of finite methods. Godel considered a formal theory $T$ which contained ordinary arithmetic, which is consistent (in a strong sense to be explained) and in which the axioms and rules of inference are either finite in number or are specfied in a recursive way; the latter is the case for all the systems we have considered. In this system $T$ he showed how to construct a sentence $G$ such that neither $G$ nor $\\neg G$ could be proved within the system. Such a $G$ is then undecidable. Its existence is Godel's first incompleteness theorem."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > Since the rules of $T$ are recursive, Godel also showed that one can formulate within the system $T$ a sentence $\\text{con}_T$ which, when interpreted, states that \"$T$ is consistent\", he then showed that this sentence could not be proved within the system. In other words, no such system $T$ is strong enough to establish its own consistency ...
