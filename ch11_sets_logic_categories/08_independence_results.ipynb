Various additional axioms have been proposed, including axioms which insure the existence of some very large cardinal numbers and an axiom of determinacy (for certain games) which in its full form contradicts the axiom of choice. This variety and the undecidability results indicate that set theory is indeterminate in principle: There is no unique and definitive list of axioms for sets; the intuitive idea of a set as a collection can lead to wildly different and mutually inconsistent formulations. On the elementary level, there are options such as ZFC, ZC, ZBQC or intuitionistic set theory; on the higher level, the method of forcing provides many alternative models with divergent properties The platonic notion that there is somewhere *the* ideal realm of sets, not yet fully desribed, is a glorious illusion."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
