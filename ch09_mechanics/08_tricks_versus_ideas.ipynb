Just as the same idea can be realized in different forms, so can the same formal success be understood by a variety of ideas. A perpicuous exposition of a piece of Mathematics would let the ideas shine through the display of manipulations."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
