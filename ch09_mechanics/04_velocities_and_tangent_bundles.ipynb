Velocities & Tangent Bundles"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > The phase space for simple harmonic motion exhibited both position and velocity. Similarly the quantities $q^i$ (position) and $\\dot{q}^i$ (velocity) are the coordinates for the *phase space* of the motion. A point in this space is a point in the configuration space $C$ plus a tangent vector at that point. In other words, it is a point on the tangent bundle $B.C$ to $C$ - which we write with the letter $B$, to avoid confusion with the use of the letter $T$ for kinetic energy. Thus the device of thinking of a point moving in such a phase space is really equivalent ot the geometric idea of using a tangent bundle to a manifold."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
