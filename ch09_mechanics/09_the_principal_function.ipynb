As a function of time and the end-point of the trajectory, $S$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equation. Conversely ... suitable solutions of the HJPDE give the trajectories, often called the *characteristics* of the P.D.E. This is a first indication of the important of P.D.E. in mechanics (and also in quantum mechanics\" ..."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
