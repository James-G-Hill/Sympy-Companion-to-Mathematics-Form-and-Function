Nevertheless, it is suggestive to think that the reciprocal $w = 1 / z$ of a complex number $z$ should approach infinity as $z$ approaches zero. This does not mean that there is a *number* $\\infty$ in the field **C** of complex numbers, but it does mean that there is a geometric model which adds a \"point\" at \"infinity\" to the complex plane."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import cmath\n","\n","def riemann_sphere_z(r, phi):\n","    \"\"\" Calculates z for the Riemann Sphere. \"\"\"\n","    return r * cmath.e ** (1j * math.radians(phi))\n","\n","\n","def riemann_sphere_w(r, phi):\n","    \"\"\" Calculates w for the Riemann Sphere. \"\"\"\n","    return (1 / r) * cmath.e ** (-1j * math.radians(phi))\n","\n","\n","def reciprocal_transformation(z):\n","    \"\"\" Returns w from reciprocal transformation. \"\"\"\n","    if z == 0:\n","        w = cmath.inf\n","    elif z == cmath.inf:\n","        w = 0\n","    else:\n","        w = 1 / z\n","    return w\n","\n","\n","# Test at 45 degrees\n","z, w = riemann_sphere_z(1, 45), riemann_sphere_w(1, 45)\n","print(z)\n","print(w)\n","print(cmath.isclose(reciprocal_transformation(z), w))\n",""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Calculations of the reciprocal transformation\n","print(reciprocal_transformation(0+0j))\n","print(reciprocal_transformation(2+1j))\n","print(reciprocal_transformation(0.4-0.2j))\n","print(reciprocal_transformation(cmath.inf))\n",""]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
