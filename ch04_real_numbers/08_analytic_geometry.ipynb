The need for higher dimensional geometry is motivated by phenomena which need specification of more than three coordinates: Events in space-time need four (position and time); in dynamics, the inital conditions for a particle need six, three for position and three for velocity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > Much of mathematical physics deals with phenomena in three dimensions and so often requires a formulation in triads of equations, one for each coordinate in **R**$^3$. When **R**$^3$ is regarded as a vector space, many of these equations can be written as single vector equations. This accounts for the popularity of vector analysis in Physics."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
