Complex differentiation yields the class of holomorphic functions and their remarkable properties. At the same time, these functions provide conformal maps and have application to electrostatic potential and fluid flows. The construction of a variety of holomorphic functions suggests the process of analytic continuation along a curve, which can then be codified and understood as the choice of a connected component in the big space $A$ of germs of holomorphic functions. The explicit Riemann surfaces, used to handle many-valued functions by way of slitting and pasting planes together, all fit in the big topological space $A$."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
