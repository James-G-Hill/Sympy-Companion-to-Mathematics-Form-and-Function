This is a tight control on the behaviour of holomorphic functions which has no analog for functions of a single real variable. It follows also that the values of each derivative of a holomorphic function $f$ are determined just by the values of $f$ on the boundary ..."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > ... a function $f$ holomorphic in $U$ is necessarily analytic in $U$!
