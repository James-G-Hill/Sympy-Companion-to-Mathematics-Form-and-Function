Here as elsewhere in Mathematics, the use of the infinite is an intuitively suggestive description of what is in fact a finite formal process of successive approximations."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > The idea of \"uniformity\" which is expressed here is really the *same* idea as that which appeared in the foundations of the calculus ... with the notion of uniform continuity of a function. There, as here, the formal expressions of the idea of \"uniform approximation\" depend on the use of quantifiers. This idea of uniformity can be further developed; there is for example a notion of a \"uniform space\" (specialized from topological space). The idea of uniform limits was once (early 1900s) regarded as one of the most difficult in Mathematical pedagogy. The difficulty now seems much less."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > ... a uniformly convergent series of holomorphic functions may be differentiated \"term-by-term\".
