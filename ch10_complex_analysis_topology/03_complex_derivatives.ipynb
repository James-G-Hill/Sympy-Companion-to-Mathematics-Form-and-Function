Consider for example the electrostatic field arising from electric charges distributed uniformly along one or several very long cylinders perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane. The resulting potential $u$ is then effectively constant in the coordinate perpendicular to this plane, so it can be considered just as a function of $x$ and $y$, which then must satisfy the Laplace equation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > ... holomorphic functions of a complex variable escape all the pathologies attending ordinary functions $f$ of a real variable."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
