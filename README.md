# Sympy Companion to *Maths: Form and Function*

These are my notes for *Maths: Form and Function* by Saunders Mac Lane.
My notes have used `Python` programming language.
I continue to update my notes to use the symbolic computation package `sympy`.

More information can be found here:

Suggestions for improvements to my use of `sympy` are welcome.
Please create a ticket if you would like to suggest a change.
