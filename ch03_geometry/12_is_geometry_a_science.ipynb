It is a sophisticated intellectual structure, rooted in questions about the experience of motion, of construction, of shaping.  It leads to propositions and insights which form the necessary backdrop for any science of motion or of engineering practices of construction. But at the same time, the structure of geometry is not unique. The axioms can be formulated as in the Euclidean tradition, as it was refined by Hilbert, or they can be put in group-theoretic form. Moreover, non-Euclidean geometries of plane or of space are indeed possible and useful, and they can be reduced to axiomatic form."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[" > Hence geometry is a variety of intellectual structures, closely related to each other *and* to the original experiences of space and motion."]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3},"orig_nbformat":4}}
